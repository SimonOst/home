We expect you to have a curious mind and advanced familiarity with large language models. At the very least, we expect all students to have read (and understood :-)) the <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf" >BERT paper</a> and the <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf" >Transformer paper</a>.

What you should bring is a basic understanding of deep learning methods and no fear of digging into a formula, if necessary. Still, this is going to be an application-oriented seminar rather than a mathematics course.</i></font>

                        <p>
                            The rise of deep learning in AI has dramatically increased the performance of models across many sub-fields such as natural language processing or computer vision. In the last 5 years, large pretrained language models (LLMs) and their variants (BERT, ChatGPT etc.) have changed the NLP landscape drastically. Such models got larger and larger over the last years, reaching  increasingly impressive performance peeks, sometimes even surpassing humans.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A central issue with deep learning models with millions or billions of parameters is that they are essentially <strong>black boxes</strong>: From the model's parameters, it is not inherently clear why a model exhibits a certain behavior or makes certain classification decision. The rapidly growing field of interpretable and explainable AI (XAI) develops methods to peek into the black box that LLMs are, trying to understand the inner workings of such large models.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this seminar we will investiagte a subfield in XAI, namely Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). MI aims to understand and explain the internal workings of complex machine learning models, in particular deep neural networks, by "reverse-engineering" internal mechanisms and computations inside a network's parameters. This involves analysing how certain mechanisms in the model contribute to decisions and results. The aim is to break down the ‘black box’ nature of these models and reveal the underlying calculations and internal representations that lead to predictions or behaviours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will concentrate on a range of basic methods in MI and then focus on their applications within natural language processing.
